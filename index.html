                    <p>Growing up, I wasn&#8217;t allowed to drink coffee. Like most parents, they wouldn&#8217;t their young, energetic son drink something that would give him an extra boost of energy. I eventually got my hands on it when I was a sophomore
                        in high school, but my love for coffee, especially black coffee, didn&#8217;t take off until I started working at Starbucks with my friend. He invited me over to his house one day to try some coffee out of his new coffee press,
                        which I had barely heard of before. I took one sip from that press, and the rest is history. Today, I&#8217;m a Starbucks certified coffee master and a level two coffee snob.

                    <p>My earliest memory with technology came in my first go around in kindergarten (first time, you ask? A story for another time). While everyone was drawing with their crayons and color pencils, I was in the back drawing with MacDraw
                        on an old, beige Macintosh. I was mesmerized by this thing: I could draw something with crazy effects and save it for the following week. To borrow a term from Steve Jobs, it just felt &#8220;magical.&#8221; Today, I feel the same
                        way with every slice of the technological spectrum, whether it be self-driving cars, virtual reality or the latest MacBook Pro. I&#8217;m especially fascinated with how it affects the world&#8217;s culture as a whole. Credit to the photographer:<a href="https://unsplash.com/search/iphone?photo=EG49vTtKdvI"> link</a> </p>

                    <p>This is a recent interest of mine, and is really only beginning to form, but I have fallen in love with web development. It can be frustrating at times, but I can see the utility of knowing how to create web apps and really neat looking
                        websites. Seeing how the internet ticks kind of plays on my love of technology, and is really just an extension of it. I look forward to using it as a story telling tool going into the future. Credit to the photographer:<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/I8OhOu-wLO4"> link</a> </p>

                    <p>When I tell people that I&#8217;m a basketball fanatic, they get really confused. A soft-spoken, lanky, white guy liking basketball? Its something I&#8217;ve herd throughout my life, especially in high school when I was given the nickname
                        &#8220;snowflake&#8221; from the other guys in my basketball &#8220;class.&#8221; I was born into a basketball household, with my dad being a season ticket holder with the Miami Heat since their introduction into the NBA in 1988.
                        I would watch every Heat game, collect every players card and play in my own leagues growing up. I don&#8217;t have much time to play today, but I always do my homework with TNT on in the background every Thursday to catch every
                        game I can. Credit to the photographer:<a href="https://unsplash.com/search/basketball?photo=zjEsQhDD39I"> link</a> </p>
